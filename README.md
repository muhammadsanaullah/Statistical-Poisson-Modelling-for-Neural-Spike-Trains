# Statistical-Poisson-Modelling-for-Neural-Spike-Trains
Analysis of homogenous Poisson processes modelling neural spike trains in MATLAB.

In most neuroscientific experiments, we already have available spike trains from neurons, but sometimes it is useful for our understanding to model them from scratch, to form some mathematical intuition behind them. This chapter introduces the Poisson random process as a model to characterize trains of action potentials generated by neurons. We will generate a homogeneous Poisson process using MATLAB and determine how well it captures the statistical properties of real neuronal spike trains. A Poisson process is a random process in which events occur independently with low probability over continuous time. While the Poisson process does meet most criteria for a neural spike train, the refractory period and other features prevent statistical independence. However, as a first approximation, a Poisson process provides a good tool for exploring neural spike trains
